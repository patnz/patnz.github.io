      Describing my values in bullet points
      
      Family-oriented
      This comes down to a number of things: my mum being one of eleven children, my father being so close with his family and his family-first way, and now having eight nieces and nephews. Periods of my life have been more family-oriented than others (like when I moved to the UK, less so), but it is always on my mind. I try to be one of the best people in the lives of those closest to me.
      
      Open-minded
      I have always been a curious person. I have grown a lot since my teenage years and have used this new perspective to look back and reflect on who I was and how I saw the world then. I am interested in cause and effect and I try to be descriptive of things as they are, rather than prescriptive of how they should be, according to me. 
      
      For the greater good
      I am someone who is quite often thinking about others and how my actions are going to affect them. I always refill the kettle after I have used it. I like to consider the what-ifs and preempt them.
      
      Transparent
      More and more in my life I have been trying to be more transparent. I have had experiences with other people where things will go unsaid and boil over. Animosity is held but never addressed. I try to evaluate the situation, and if appropriate, tackle the problem head-on. You have to read the room of course, but there is no time like the present to let your feelings be heard.
      
      Jack of all trades, master of none
      I am always up to learn a new skill, or challenge myself. If I can do it myself, I will try. If there are no specialised tools required, I will try. If it is really hard, I like to imagine I am almost there.

      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      
      One day, working as a picture framer, I was fitting a painted canvas with hangers. While doing this, my hand slipped, stabbing a hole right through the front of the artwork. It wasn’t the Mona Lisa (besides, I think that’s painted on a wooden board), but still, we try to treat all artwork that comes through our shop with the same value. I felt awful. I let my manager know, who contacted an art restorer to repair the artwork as best they could. I asked if they wanted me to notify the client and they said that would be done once they’ve heard back from the restorer. A little while later, the artwork had been repaired, good as new, but the client had still not been contacted. A week passed, and I realised that the client had collected her artwork while I was out of the shop. After asking around, it seemed like no one had notified her of what had happened. I asked the business owner who seemed fine with leaving her in the dark about what had happened.
       
      At this point, if I were to do nothing, she would likely never find out. The repair job was so good that it was really hard to tell from the front that anything had happened, and the back was sealed with a dust-cover, which hid any repair work. I assumed she had not and would not notice anything out of the ordinary. On the other hand, if she did eventually find out what had happened and that we kept it from her intentionally, this would be worse than coming clean in the first place.
      
      If we were to come clean, and be fully transparent, admitting to my mistake, she would see that we have done everything in our power to right this wrong and had been honest about what happened. This would punctuate the situation and leave us all on the same page. Being honest in this moment meant that there was no chance of a surprise visit from the client some time in the future, and more importantly it meant that we were not deceiving anyone.
      
      Anyway… I asked him if it was alright that I contacted the client to let her know about my art-destroying-episode. He was lukewarm to the idea but said that was alright, admitting it was probably the right thing to do. I picked up the phone and rang. I told her exactly what had happened. She was lovely, and everything was fine. It was a painting she had done herself, and she didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary, saying that the restorer must have done a great job. We offered her a discount on her next framing job and all was good in the world.
      
      In reflecting on this, I am so glad that I had the foresight to imagine what that conversation with the client would look like. We often dread hard-to-have conversations, and imagine them being so much worse than the reality. If I had been impressionable, and gone along with the intentions of my boss, it never would have been addressed. Challenging his approach to the situation meant that we could all land on the same page and move forward.
      
      
      
      
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
      
      I am a family-oriented person, and I think this comes down to a number of things: my mum being one of eleven children, my father being so close with his family and his family-first way of life. Not to mention having eight nieces and nephews. Periods of my life have been more family-oriented than others (like when I moved to the UK, less so), but it is always on my mind. I try to be a positive influence in the lives of those closest to me. I want to be someone that those around me can come to for advice and guidance, and I want to share my experiences with them so that we can learn from them together.
      
      My mum is a particularly selfless person. She is very considerate of others and how her actions affect those around her. I see a lot of this in myself. Whether it is something simple like refilling the kettle after I have used it, or something much bigger, I try to consider and positively impact the lives of others.
      
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      
      I am a people-oriented person, find it easy to get on with people
      Making connections and friends along this learning journey will be incredibly important. I think that the key to solidifying any learning will be to share it with others.
      
      I am a jack of all trades, master of none
      This bootcamp is all about breadth of knowledge. In my personal life, I have a wide and varied range of interests and I enjoy being able to combine these skills when I am able. I think this attitude is going to be very applicable when it comes to our learning journey.
      
      I am a creative person
      I think there will always be capacity for creativity in this learning journey. Creativity doesn’t have to be ‘creating something’, it can be thinking about something familiar in a new and different way, and finding a perspective that someone else might not have considered.
      
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      
      I doubt myself
      I tend to imagine that everyone is smarter than me, is more productive than me and finds everything easier than I do. I think this way of thinking leads to all sorts of problems - envy, jealousy, self-loathing. I think that it is important to try and escape this mindset and instead embrace what I am doing in this moment, rather than considering how far ahead of me others might be.
      
      Easily distracted
      I think that my mind tends to wander, and I find it very easy to spend time in an unproductive way when there is some pressing issue at hand. This will certainly not fly when working collaboratively, but I think having that accountability will help me stay on task.
      
      
      
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      
      In my most recent role I was working within a team to digitise and file physical documents along with incoming digital documents. It was not a whole lot of fun, but they were paying me to do it. I was on contract, so I would often get some of the more tedious tasks, sparing the full-timers of the monotony. I was working in a team with two other temporary staff.
      
      We quickly became all too familiar with the processes in place. We agreed, some of them did not make a whole lot of sense and I found it hard to spend my days working in an inefficient way, doubling our workload in some places.
      
      I spoke with my manager about the potential of reviewing these processes and spending some time coming up with a better way of doing things. She was a bit dismissive and said she didn’t have the time, so I plodded along.
      
      A week or two passes and I feel myself burning out. I know there is a better way to do this. I discuss this with the team members I am working with. They agree that there is room for improvement and offer some suggestions and a little brainstorming ensues.
      
      I could go on and on about what I did to try and improve the processes but I don’t think that is the point of this reflection.
      
      What happened was, I was met with resistance from my manager when I tried to suggest spending time on reviewing and improving the process. This process is not something that she spends any time dealing with, and didn’t have a lot of empathy for the situation because of it. After discussing the inefficiencies with my colleagues and reaching a consensus, I tried speaking with my manager again, but this time trying to articulate the issue more clearly and explaining that this is not just my opinion but one shared by the team. We offered some potential solutions and explained the reduction of work in some cases. She obliged and was willing for me to spend time trying to resolve the issue and improve the process. Sharing mine and my teammates’ perspective and outlining the issues clearly was a very effective strategy as it allowed our manager to see the process from our perspective.
      
      In future situations like this, I think it is important to be able to explain the problem in a simple way, and be ready to offer ideas and solutions. Showing that this is a shared perspective and that it has been discussed within the team is also key. Trying to see this from our manager’s perspective was what allowed us to be more persuasive in our approach to trying to have the processes reviewed.
