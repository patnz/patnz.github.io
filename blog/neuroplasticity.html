        <p>When we talk about Neuroplasticity, we talk about the ongoing structural changes that occur within the brain, when different parts of it are activated. This means that our brains are dynamic and respond differently to certain stimuli. Historically it was understood that after a certain age, the brain’s development and structural change would cease. More recently, we have come to understand that the brain continues to reorganise neural pathways and adapt to change, like in the case of injury. Not only does this plasticity of the brain have significance for recovery from brain injury, but we can use it to our advantage when it comes to learning new skills and remembering newly learned information. With this knowledge in hand, we are able to engage in things like spaced repetition training where we regularly fire certain neural pathways that relate to the information we are trying to retain.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">Plastic people? Plastic minds?</h2>
          <p>Understanding Neuroplasticity can be beneficial for learners because it means they recognise how the brain can reorganise itself, forming new connections and making existing ones stronger. As learners, it is helpful to remain conscious of this so that we remember to exercise our brains by recalling newly learnt information and solidifying that knowledge.</p>
          <p>It is helpful to remind ourselves also, to keep testing ourselves with difficult problem-solving challenges that will help us create new neural connections and pathways.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">...what do I do with this information?</h2>
          <p>Repetition is key to retaining information and taking advantage of our knowledge of Neuroplasticity. By regularly activating neural pathways and revisiting newly learnt information, we lay a strong foundation for retention.</p>
          <p>It is also suggested that practising mindfulness regularly can increase neuroplasticity within the areas of the brain that are associated with emotional intelligence and attention.</p>
          <p>Pushing ourselves mentally and testing ourselves with difficult problem-solving tasks can also be a great way to forge new neural pathways and stretch out that brainy brain of ours.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">How can I stretch out my brain?</h2>
          <p>I don’t mean to sound like a life coach, but three of the most important things you can do to increase your neuroplasticity are exercising regularly, learning new skills, and practising mindfulness.</p>
          <p>It is no surprise that research shows regular physical activity has a significantly positive effect on brain health. This includes things like cognitive function and neuroplasticity. Exercise tends to increase the growth and survival rate of neurons in the brain.</p>
          <p>Challenging the brain by learning new skills has also been shown to increase neural activity and in turn neuroplasticity. Performing activities that require long periods of focus and mental effort have been shown to stimulate the growth of new brain cells and increased memory function.</p>
          <p>Practising mindfulness has been linked with the area of the brain known as the hippocampus which has a lot to do with memory and learning function. Regular practice of mindfulness has also been shown to reduce anxiety and stress, while increasing our focus and cognitive function.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">Growth Mindset or Fixed Mindset? Which one am I?</h2>
          <p>It is up to you! On the one hand, having a growth mindset means that you embrace challenges and see things that you find difficult as opportunities to learn and grow from experience. On the other hand, having a fixed mindset is to assume that your skills and intelligence are inherent and are not likely to change. </p>
          <p>There is no doubt in my mind that through hard work and dedication you will be able to learn and master new skills, become more intelligent, and develop desired personal qualities. Is the other option accepting what you have got, admitting defeat in the face of adversity and relegating yourself to a life deprived of personal development? I’ll take the first option please.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">Is any of this surprising?</h2>
          <p>I wouldn’t say I am entirely surprised to learn, but I found it interesting to think about how we can all have different mindsets in different parts of our lives. Like, it is easier to have a growth mindset in a field in which we excel, because we know what it is like to improve our abilities within that area.</p>
          <p>However, it is much harder to achieve a growth mindset in an area where we have rarely dedicated ourselves, and find it far more difficult. I think it is important to remain mindful of the fact that we can achieve a growth mindset in any aspect of our lives, regardless of how difficult it is.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">How can I integrate this in to my learning journey?</h2>
          <p>Being challenged is not learning, but embracing a challenge and persevering in the face of it, is where we really develop as individuals. In terms of my own personal learning journey, I plan to integrate this mindset by reminding myself that the frustration that comes with difficult-to-solve problems is an opportunity to grow.</p>
          <p>I need to reflect during times like these, and ask myself questions about whether I am managing my frustration well, and whether I am working in an efficient way to solve the problem. It is easy to be overwhelmed by these sorts of challenges, but it is important to reflect on them while we are in them, appreciate them for what they are (opportunities for growth), and try and get the most out of them.</p>
