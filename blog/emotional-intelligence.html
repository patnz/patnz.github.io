          <h2 class="main-section-title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) simply put, is one’s ability to recognise and regulate emotions. It is having an understanding and awareness of how we might react in any given situation, and having that inform our actions. Emotional intelligence encompasses a set of skills at our disposal to navigate these events in a considered way. This set of skills includes things like empathy, self-awareness and pattern recognition, and are things that can be learned and trained over time. Spending time developing these skills can have a hugely positive impact on our lives. </p>

          <!-- <p>Emotional intelligence is not limited to just us as individuals, but it also includes our ability to perceive the emotions of others and take that into consideration.</p> -->

          <p>Being aware of our emotions means that we are able to make a choice about how we let them affect our lives. By taking a step back and thinking about how our emotions might affect our judgement, means that we can be more intentional about our decision-making and the way we choose to live. Considering how others are feeling or how our actions might affect them, will have a positive impact on the lives of those around us.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
          <p>An <i>intelligence quotient</i> is assessed through a standardised test which has been designed to measure a range of cognitive abilities. Cognitive abilities that are tested include things like quantitative and perceptual reasoning, working memory, verbal comprehension and processing speed. Generally speaking, an intelligence quotient is calculated by assessing the performance of an individual in one of these standardised tests, and that score is then compared to a sample of people within the same age group. An individual's intelligence quotient is then measured by their score’s deviation from the average score of that group.</p>

          <p>Although intelligence quotient has been widely used as a measure of intelligence and cognitive abilities, we must keep in mind that these tests do not measure things like emotional intelligence and other creative or practical skills.</p>

          <p>On the one hand, intelligence quotient represents one’s ability to solve problems, their logic and reasoning abilities and their knack for understanding abstract ideas. On the other hand, <i>emotional quotient</i> (referring to Emotional Intelligence) refers to a set of skills which one might use to navigate their everyday life and engage in social interactions. Like an intelligence quotient, an emotional quotient can also be measured through various questionnaires and assessments.</p> 

          <p>Opinions have changed over the years, regarding the significance of one’s intelligence quotient and what impact it might have on a person's life. There are recognised links between an above average intelligence quotient and one’s academic performance and salary. At the same time, emotional intelligence is widely accepted to have a significant impact on one's ability to build long-lasting personal and professional relationships.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">Why is EQ important?</h2>
          <p>Being human is not easy, and none of us are perfect. Our upbringing has a lot to do with the way in which we react in any given situation. Some of us are lucky enough to have been blessed with people in our lives who either actively or passively, have taught us how to recognise and manage our emotions from a young age. These emotions can run high at times and we can make rash decisions. Being aware of our emotions and recognising when they are getting the best of us allows us to make better decisions in our own lives, and have a more positive impact on the lives of others. Regardless of our upbringing, we must come to understand the importance of emotional intelligence and how key it is to developing personal and professional relationships.</p>
          <p>I like to think of emotional intelligence as our ability to read the room. You exist within this room, and it is important to assess what emotions you are bringing into it and how it might affect others in here. At the same time, it is important to look around and see the other people in this room, and what sort of mood or mindset they are bringing in. Recognising our emotions and being considerate of the emotions of others allows us to be strategic about our actions in any circumstance. As someone who strives to have a positive impact on the lives of others, I think it is very important to take time to consider other perspectives. </p>
          <p>Being able to empathise with others, and recognise the patterns of our own emotions can play a critical role in our ability to foster meaningful relationships both in our personal and professional life.</p>
