      Formulate Learning Plan

      Time to formulate your Learning Plan! Write your findings on a temporary document (Google Docs, Notepad/TextEdit etc.). The Learning Plan needs to include the following:
      What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      That is a good question. It is something that I should be thinking about more - what a career in tech will look like for me. While I am at Dev Academy, I should be looking around at what sort of opportunities will be available to me once I have graduated. I need to figure out what I am interested in. It might pay to look into technical skills that are ‘hot off the press’, which I could incorporate into my work here at Dev Academy. This might give me an advantage once I am out there looking for a job and show that I am staying up to date with new technologies.
      In an ideal world, I would leave Dev Academy with the knowledge and skills to land a junior web developer role. Once I arrive, I would make a point of showing that I am eager to learn and take on new challenges in that role. I want progression. There is nothing better than being paid to learn how to do something and gaining new skills. From there I would hope to get a sense of where my technical strengths lie and have a taste for what roles are out there that will excite me.
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      One of my main strengths is my curiosity. I am someone who is driven to try and understand a concept or idea from the ground up. I want to see the big picture, and I try to do this by embracing different perspectives and asking questions others might not ask. The limitations of this however, is the time it takes to understand complex ideas and realise them fully. You have to pick your moments, and I need to be mindful about when it is appropriate to dive deep, and when I should be content with a basic understanding of something and move on. Time is of the essence!
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      Something I have recently been focusing on more in my personal and professional life, has been trying to be more transparent. No one can read my mind. I am trying to let others in more. I want to continue this trend at Dev Academy, and be open about what is on my mind and how I am feeling. I want to work on communicating effectively, whether it is about a project we are working on together, or how I am coping generally.
      Since landing in Foundations, I have made a good effort to try and manage my time better. I think this is something that I have always struggled with. I want to use my time more effectively and maintain focus on the task at hand. Pomodoro baby!
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      Working in collaboration with others at Dev Academy will mean that we are accountable for each other. I will work to make sure that I am communicating effectively with my team and checking in with each other regularly.
      I should make use of the skills and knowledge of others at Dev Academy - there are some smart cookies here. I should also check in with our facilitators to make sure that I am on the right track and following best practices. Especially when I am down the rabbit hole and doubting myself.
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      I am lucky to have a supportive partner in my life who is there to help me manage any periods of stress. It is important to have a voice to talk to. Quite often, you already know what needs to be done, but talking through it out loud can be the catharsis that you need. I should also embrace the fact that I am on this journey with my peers at Dev Academy and should reach out to them and we can lend our support and advice to one another.
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      I have been spending five minutes journaling every day about my experience, checking in with myself and asking how I am doing. I am trying to be as honest as possible. This means I can see the warning signs ahead of time and make sure that I am not in over my head.
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      I would like for them to be there when I need them, and offer encouragement when I am struggling. I would also like for them to facilitate equity within the cohort and give everyone a chance to contribute and shine. 
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      Getting to the gym regularly has done wonders for my physical and mental wellbeing recently so I would like to keep that up. This is something I can work in whenever suits though.
      I am attending a music festival on Waitangi weekend (4th Feb to 6th of Feb) - thankfully this is during Foundations and I will be doing extra work outside of that time to make sure I am on track
      I have a wedding to go to on the weekend of the 11th of March. I will have to work extra hard to make sure I don’t lose too much momentum while I am away.
      Your Facilitator will review your Learning Plan at the end of this Sprint.
