        <h2 class="main-section-title">What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>I am moving to Melbourne! That means that my career pathway will start there. While at Bootcamp, I need to start getting an idea of what the job market looks like. I want that makes use of my Javascript skills, while still challenging me - somewhere I want to I need to assume it is going to be tough. I need to try and make connections where I can, before I arrive. What will set me apart from others is working on personal projects that showcase my coding skills. I need to start thinking about this sooner rather than later. I would like to be applying for jobs before I arrive, and before Careers Week is over. After landing a job as a developer (which I definitely will), I need to not become complacent. I'm keen to learn Python and C# too. I need to keep growing.</p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <h2 class="main-section-title">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>I have had an experience where I am stuck, and I ask for help, and someone explains something to me that I don't understand. And when they explain it to me, they explain it in a way where they assume I know more than I do. They gloss over other pieces of the puzzle with the assumption that I have a good understanding of <i>that</i> part, and I will most likely smile and nod as if I understand what they're talking about, wait until they walk away, and be stuck exactly where I was in the first place. I think this is a pride thing. In that moment I feel too embarrased to let them know that I am even further from understanding than they assumed I was. What does this mean? It means that I would rather have someone else think I understand something, and not actually understand it, than have someone know I don't understand something and explain it to me. That is cray cray...</p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <h2 class="main-section-title">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I want to be able to communicate clearly and effectively. I think that this will be an invaluable skill in Bootcamp and later in the workplace. Being able to have someone understand exactly what you're thinking is a skill. I want to put myself in the shoes of the person hearing what I am saying, before I choose the words I use. It is far too easy to assume someone you are talking to is able to read between the lines, or assume they understand the same things you do.

      <section class="main-section">
        <h2 class="main-section-title">How will I manage my workload and expectations of myself during Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>They're saying 60 hours a week. That is a lot. I need to make sure I don't neglect the people in my life I care about. I think a really good idea would be to stick to a sort of 8.30am to 6pm on campus Monday to Friday sort of thing, with maybe three days during the week that I stick around until 7pm or 8pm. That will get me pretty close to 60 hours. On top of that, I will spend half a day on Saturday or Sunday going in to campus or working from home. I need to keep up with the journaling and reflections. I need to remind myself that there is no point spending 60 unproductive hours when I could achieve the same amount in a really productive 50 hours. I need to use my time wisely during Bootcamp.</p>

        <h2 class="main-section-title">What I expect from the Bootcamp team:</h2>
        <p>It is nice to have already met both of the Human Skills facilitators here on campus. I will use my daily journaling as an opportunity to check in with myself and reach out to Joseph or Patch if I need help or am not coping with the workload/stress. If it is a technical issue, I want to be more eager to ask my peers for help.</p>
        <p>I want the facilitation team to be encouraging. I want them to support me if I am struggling. I want them to push me if I am cruising. I want them to help me get the most out of Bootcamp. I want them to offer guidance when I am lost, and offer empathy if I am feeling a bit down on myself.</p>

        <h2 class="main-section-title">Upcoming commitments outside of Dev Academy to consider:</h2>
        <p>I have a wedding on the 11th of March up near Lake Taupo! I am excited. I am also nervous. I don't want the work to get on top of me. I need to make sure I stay focused and use the time leading up to that weekend wisely to make sure I am in a good position.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>That is a good question. It is something that I should be thinking about more - what a career in tech will look like for me. While I am at Dev Academy, I should be looking around at what sort of opportunities will be available to me once I have graduated. I need to figure out what I am interested in. It might pay to look into technical skills that are ‘hot off the press’, which I could incorporate into my work here at Dev Academy. This might give me an advantage once I am out there looking for a job and show that I am staying up to date with new technologies.</p>
          <p>In an ideal world, I would leave Dev Academy with the knowledge and skills to land a junior web developer role. Once I arrive, I would make a point of showing that I am eager to learn and take on new challenges in that role. I want progression. There is nothing better than being paid to learn how to do something and gaining new skills. From there I would hope to get a sense of where my technical strengths lie and have a taste for what roles are out there that will excite me.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h2>
          <p>One of my main strengths is my curiosity. I am someone who is driven to try and understand a concept or idea from the ground up. I want to see the big picture, and I try to do this by embracing different perspectives and asking questions others might not ask. The limitations of this however, is the time it takes to understand complex ideas and realise them fully. You have to pick your moments, and I need to be mindful about when it is appropriate to dive deep, and when I should be content with a basic understanding of something and move on. Time is of the essence!</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p>Something I have recently been focusing on more in my personal and professional life, has been trying to be more transparent. No one can read my mind. I am trying to let others in more. I want to continue this trend at Dev Academy, and be open about what is on my mind and how I am feeling. I want to work on communicating effectively, whether it is about a project we are working on together, or how I am coping generally.</p>
          <p>Since landing in Foundations, I have made a good effort to try and manage my time better. I think this is something that I have always struggled with. I want to use my time more effectively and maintain focus on the task at hand. Pomodoro baby!</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme:</h2>
          <p>Working in collaboration with others at Dev Academy will mean that we are accountable for each other. I will work to make sure that I am communicating effectively with my team and checking in with each other regularly.</p>
          <p>I should make use of the skills and knowledge of others at Dev Academy - there are some smart cookies here. I should also check in with our facilitators to make sure that I am on the right track and following best practices. Especially when I am down the rabbit hole and doubting myself.</p>
          <p>I am lucky to have a supportive partner in my life who is there to help me manage any periods of stress. It is important to have a voice to talk to. Quite often, you already know what needs to be done, but talking through it out loud can be the catharsis that you need. I should also embrace the fact that I am on this journey with my peers at Dev Academy and should reach out to them and we can lend our support and advice to one another.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way:</h2>
          <p>I have been spending five minutes journaling every day about my experience, checking in with myself and asking how I am doing. I am trying to be as honest as possible. This means I can see the warning signs ahead of time and make sure that I am not in over my head.</p>

          <p>I am attending a music festival on Waitangi weekend (4th Feb to 6th of Feb) - thankfully this is during Foundations and I will be doing extra work outside of that time to make sure I am on track.</p>
          <p>I have a wedding to go to on the weekend of the 11th of March. I will have to work extra hard to make sure I don’t lose too much momentum while I am away.</p>
