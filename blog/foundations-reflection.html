          <h2 class="main-section-title">What surprised me the most about 'core' learning is...</h2>
          <p>...was how lucky I felt about being given the opportunity to reflect on myself and what I want to see in myself. I mean, we have the opportunity to do this every day. I’ve been to university, and they don’t teach you this shit. Having blocks of time where we are expected to research and write about the values and qualities we want to see in ourselves has been great for me. I am someone who would like to bring positivity into the lives of others, but spending time thinking about how I am going to go about that will only improve my ability to do it. Spending time reflecting on how I learn best has been great too.

          <h2 class="main-section-title">Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to core learning are...</h2>
          <p>I have learned how to better manage and quiet my superego. I have always been quick to judge myself and doubt my efforts. Spending time reflecting on this fact has given me more inclination to recognise when this is happening and do away with all of these negative thoughts. This means I can focus on the task at hand, assume that I am headed in the right direction, and not worry too much about what others are doing.</p>
          <p>I have spent time actively thinking about how I need to embrace a growth mindset. It is hard to imagine yourself being really good at something if you have never done it before. The more things you try, the more things you become good at. The more things you are good at, the easier it is to imagine yourself being good at something you have never done before. I am blessed with a natural tendency to try my hand at a lot of different things. Not all things though. Still, there is going to be plenty of new opportunities during boot camp that I might tend to shy away from. Instead, I am going to try and actively bring myself out of my comfort zone.</p>
          <p>It is empowering to have a really good sense of self. My experience during Foundations core content has allowed me to better understand what I am like. When I come to notice negative things about myself, in the past I have let it get me down. Like, it bruised my ego to see something in myself I didn't think was good enough. In reality, it is a positive thing. As long as that criticism is driven by the values I hold, I think I should be seeing it as an opportunity to take a step in the right direction. Being kind to myself while giving constructive feedback is going to go a long way.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">What are the role of values, empathy in self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>Like in life, our values will guide and drive us through our learning journey and programming careers. I want to have a positive impact on the people around me. How do I do that? By making sure I am taking care of myself, by considering the emotions of others and by being encouraging of others’ efforts. It sounds like some sort of ‘What Would Jesus Do’ thing but I’m serious, we should all be treating each other the way we want to be treated. “You hella sick bruh”.</p>
          <p>It is important to have empathy for the people you spend time with. Some may breeze through life. For others, every day can be a battle. We shouldn’t be so quick to judge, as we don’t know what others go through. Like in life, this rings true in any learning environment. It is important to consider the emotions of others. That being said, time should be spent reminding ourselves not to be too hard on ourselves. From time to time, we all need to give ourselves a break.</p>
          <p>Self-awareness in learning and programming means taking time out to check in with ourselves. Programming can be incredibly frustrating sometimes, so it is wise to give ourselves time to come up for air when we need it. Regularly taking stock of our feelings and emotions, how productive we are being or how long we have spent on a certain problem, means we are more likely to recognise when things aren’t going so well. Recognising this early on can save a lot of time that would have been otherwise wasted on a dead-end road.</p>

          <h2 class="main-section-title">What has surprised me the most about the core learning...</h2>
          <p>I am wondering why the hell this sort of stuff isn’t incorporated into traditional learning. I am sure even today, there is hardly any emphasis put on learning to learn, or improving emotional intelligence. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p class="center-text"><i>Trying to remember everything!</i></p>
          <p>There was a period where I took a break because of some stuff going on in my personal life and I was amazed at how much I had lost in that space of time. I should have known. I’ve learnt Spanish for a couple of years now, and I know all too well what it is like to not do any study for a few weeks and lose so much of it. How can you attach any new pieces you’ve learned if you can’t remember how the stuff your attaching it to works?</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">"Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?"
          </h2>
          <p>I’m sure there are many reasons... For one, we are just about to go through a really intense experience together with a bunch of what were previously strangers. Taking time to make sure we are all thinking about our own wellbeing as well as the wellbeing of others, is going to be a really important part of that. Another thing is that EDA is asking the question ‘What kind of developer would someone want to hire?’ and the answer to to ‘What kind of person would I want as my neighbour?’. The answers to both of these questions are going to be similar... Someone who is in touch with themselves and someone who considers how their actions might affect others. And of course, someone who doesn’t mind watering the plants while you’re away.</p>

        <section class="main-section">
          <h2 class="main-section-title">"Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer."
          </h2>
          <p>It doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I have heard that there is less time spent on Core stuff during bootcamp, so I feel like it is really important to set the tone early. For some of us, the core learning we have done so far during Foundations will be some of the most self-reflection we have done in a long time. I am someone who has gone through long periods of my life without asking myself the hard questions. As I said earlier, there is huge value in making sure we are all on the same page, and equipped with the right skills to manage a stress. The more we think about how our actions affect others, the better our environment will be for everyone. I think bootcamp will be a much nicer place because of it.</p>
